  <p class="about-the-author">
    Wilson Bendrick Hayes is a nom de plume that is a story in and of itself.<br><br>
Dan Wilson, Stephanie Bendrick, and Denise Hayes are Air Force siblings who grew up
constantly relocating. Friends and homes came and went, but their one consistency was a
strong family bond. As they came of age, all three went their separate ways – Dan to Los
Angeles, Stephanie to Colorado with her husband, and Denise continued to travel with her
military spouse and family. Each sibling pursued a different career path, and their personalities
grew in vastly different directions.<br><br>
One fateful holiday, Denise’s children inspired Stephanie and Denise to propose an idea to their
brother, a screenwriter for major studios by trade. By nightfall, the three conjured up a
children’s story concept that later evolved into a young adult novel. The three of them attended
seminars, outlined story, wrote rough drafts, edited, and rewrote. They used their unique
perspectives as tools and shared childhood passions as glue, pushing through the barriers.
Mirroring the theme of Darkender and Lightgiver, the power of family came together – Wilson
Bendrick Hayes became an unstoppable union.<br><br>
Inspired by their experience, Denise achieved her master’s in creative writing, Stephanie’s keen
editorial eye blossomed, and Dan, having added more screenplays and video games to his
resume, tackled his greatest challenge – the novel.<br><br>
Forged in the intersection of sibling rivalry and childhood comradery, the first novel in the
Darkender and Lightgiver series is now at hand.<br><br>
